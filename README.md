# Basic 3D Renderer 🧊
Allows user to walk through a 3D space populated with cubes and pyramids.

## Usage
Just download web.html and script.js, put them in the same folder, and open up web.html in your browser. Verified to work on Microsoft Edge v144. Use ⬅️⬆️⬇️➡️ to move around, and <kbd>A</kbd>/<kbd>D</kbd> for changing camera angle to left or right respectively.

## Next Steps
- Add looking up or down
- Fix bug where rendering is hugely off if shapes are supposed to be off canvas
- Allow STL imports
- Allow click and drag shape creation + movement + rotation + spin. 
- Add sliders for camera distance
- Fix light rendering errors
- Possibly add raytracing for shadows

### Note
For personal learning, applying UTM's MAT240 lin alg concepts.
